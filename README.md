# 📜 Quote Logger - Node.js Beginner Project

Welcome to my first Node.js project! This is part of my learning journey to understand how backend systems work using only **core Node.js modules** — without any external frameworks like Express.

## 🚀 What is Quote Logger?

**Quote Logger** is a simple web-based Node.js application that:

- Lets users **submit their own quotes**
- Stores submitted quotes in a local `.txt` file
- Logs each submission with a **timestamp**
- Lets users **view all submitted quotes**
- Uses **only built-in Node.js modules**: `http`, `fs`, `path`, `events`

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to build a basic **HTTP server** using the `http` module
- How to **read/write files** using `fs`
- How to handle paths safely with the `path` module
- How to **create and listen for custom events** with the `events` module
- How to process basic **HTML forms with POST requests**

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Node.js (core modules only)
- HTML/CSS (basic frontend)
- No frameworks, no databases — pure Node.js
